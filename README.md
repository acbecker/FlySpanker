# FlySpanker - Blink Comparator

FlySpanker is an iOS app for comparing two photos by rapidly alternating ("blinking") between them. This technique, inspired by astronomical blink comparators, makes it easy to spot differences between similar images.

## Features

- **Blink Comparison**: Rapidly alternate between two photos to spot differences
- **Automatic Alignment**: Uses Vision framework to align photos taken from slightly different positions
- **Foreground Masking**: Intelligent masking to align based on background, ignoring moving subjects
- **Color Matching**: Automatic color/exposure matching between photos

## Use Cases

- Spot the difference games
- Before/after comparisons
- Detecting changes in scenes over time
- Quality control and inspection
- Astronomical discovery (like the original blink comparators!)

## Privacy
